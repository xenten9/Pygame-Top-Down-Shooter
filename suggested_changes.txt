## Non-Started

    Move constants that relate to a specific class to within that class.
        NOTE there are some exceptions to this such as screen size but IG, its better form.

    Rename all files to be lowercase.
        NOTE Excluding README.md.

    Create a class to encapsulate all screen/display actions.
        NOTE this would have method taht would allow for the rendering
        of images at a given position on the screen.

    Generalize display actions to avoid having to change two places at once.
        NOTE as an example of this instead of having it have a draw class which
        iterates over all of the objects in their different handlers,
        it would be better for it to receive instructions from all of
        the objects which were called somewhere else.

    Add a overarching object handler/handler handler.
        NOTE this may come in the form of just ObjHandler and have methods like:
        ObjHandler.draw() => Call all objecsts .draw() methods
        ObjHandler.update() => Call all objecsts .update() methods

    Make sure no line in a file exceeds 79 characters.
        NOTE this would allow you to dual screen two code blocks at a normal size.

    Use more from w import x, y, z.
        NOTE This allows for a lot less refference when importing.
        EX.
            import pygame
            pygame.image.load()

            from pygame import image
            image.load()
        this simplifies things a great deal.
        although it should be noted that namespaces can be a bit vague.
        in order to improve this you could do one of two things
            import pygame as pg
            pg.image.load()

            from pygame import image as pgimage
            pgimage.load()
        both of these aren't perfect, but as you project becomes more encapsulated,
        it will make more sense.

    Remove all examples of * imports.
        NOTE this isn't required but it is good practice to do so.


## Started



## Complete

    Expand the gitignore.
        NOTE a lot of parts of the gitignore are not required in the
        immediate state of the project but in future may be required.
